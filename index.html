                    <h3>About Me:</h3>
                    <p class="pg1">Hi, my name is Jeffrey Caton Jr. I was born 
                    in Washington DC April 25th 1990. From the earliest age I have
                    had extremely difficulty with learning: I was held back in the
                    first grade, and had a mild speach impediment problem as well as
                    being un-believable slow in processing information and organizing
                    information in my head.
                    </p>                    
              
                    <p class="pg2">I was fortunate to have been around amazing 
                    people my entire life. Above all these individuals who helped 
                    raised me all stressed that the most important thing is to be a man
                    with the highest level of integrity, Character is of the utmost importance 
                    when dealing with an individual, e.g. if hiring a new employee, 'inteligence' 
                    does not trump character.
                    </p>   
               
                    <p class="pg3">Finally, with respect to learning I have come to 
                    accept that IQ doesn't exist, it is an illusion. I was once told that
                    a genius is simply someone who gets interested in a topic. A few years ago
                    my computer was hacked.  <br>
                    
                    <p class="pg4"> From that moment I have almost become obssessed
                    with wanting to understand how to control machineses. I undertook this 
                    challenged to obtain Full-Stack Developer Cert to launch myself in the
                    amazing world of software to help design a better world, becuase the 
                    state of this world (although great in many aspects) is un-sustainable, 
                    counter-productive, and completely un-neccesary.
